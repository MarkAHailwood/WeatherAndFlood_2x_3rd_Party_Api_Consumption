# WeatherAndFlood_2x_3rd_Party_Api_Consumption
A .Net Core 3.1. app I created that consumes a free flood data API, and a subscription weather data api using IHttpClient that uses a key. 
They map the returned JSON to objects and display it on razor pages. 
This is a good modern example of using interfaces and JSON converters asynchronously. Fast, lightweight and simple!
